        <h2>What is CLOS?</h2>
        <p>CLOS, also known as the Command Line Operating System, was originally a terminal program which is focused on Math that was later converted to a user-friendly GUI.</p>
        <p>It is a calculator that comes with a linear and quadratic equation solver capable of handling non-real numbers.</p>
        <p>It also has several features pertaining to graphing, derivatives, integrals, trigonometry, logarithms, algebra, and much more.</p>
        <p class="buffer"></p>
        <h2>Why CLOS?</h2>
        <p>CLOS is a great tool for students and professionals alike. It is useful for students to learn and understand math concepts, and for professionals to quickly solve math problems.</p>
        <p>It is also a great tool for teachers to quickly demonstrate certain math concepts to students, as it contains step-by-step solving.</p>
        <p class="buffer"></p>
        <h2>Why the name "CLOS"?</h2>
        <p>CLOS stands for "Command Line Operating System," and was originally going to be a terminal-based operating system. But then I realized that a non-Unix-based OS with no connectivity is not a good idea.</p>
        <p>Hence, I turned it into a terminal tool that runs on an existing system, and it is now a graphical application.</p>
