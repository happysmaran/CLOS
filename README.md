<h1>CLOS</h1>
<p>CLOS, also known as the Command Line Operating System, is a operating system which is focused on Math. It features a calculator that can add user defined variables and numbers such as pi, and also comes with an equation solve capable of handling non real numbers.</p>

<p>Currently, CLOS is a beta and will remain a beta until I (the developer) become satisfied with its feature set, after which it will become a public release and be available as an actual OS as well as this C++ program (do not expect Internet functionality, though. The OS will not have it). Furthermore, features will most likely be added after the GP release to enhance the usability of CLOS or have more functionality. CLOS will continue to recieve bug fixes as long as I and my willing volunteers keep finding them.</p>

<p>After the GP release, CLOS will only recieve features when either A) I get an idea that is worthy for CLOS or B) another person suggests an idea that is worthy for CLOS and doable in pure C++.</p>

<p>If there are any bugs you find or feature requests you find, you can kindly email me at smaran@codestraightwithsmaran.org (NO SPAM).</p>
